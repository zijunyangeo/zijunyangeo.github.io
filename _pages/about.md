Hello! I am a recent Ph.D. graduate from the [Department of Geography and Geographic Information Science](https://ggis.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu), where I worked with [Dr. Chunyuan Diao](https://ggis.illinois.edu/directory/profile/chunyuan) in the [Remote Sensing Space-Time Innovation Lab](https://diaorssilab.web.illinois.edu/).

My research interest lies in the intersection of *remote sensing*, *machine learning*, *agriculture*, and *environmental sustainability*. Through the integration of multi-scale remote sensing (e.g., satellite, drone, and near-surface platforms), field data collection, and advanced spatiotemporal modeling, I aim to better understand ecosystem dynamics under the changing climate. My recent and ongoing works have been focusing on near real-time crop characterization (e.g., crop type mapping, crop phenology forecasting), spatiotemporal fusion of multi-scale remote sensing images, and modeling climate change impacts on agricultural systems (e.g., how disturbance events affect crop production). 

Prior to UIUC, I obtained my Master of Science in Natural Resources and Environment from the [University of Michigan](https://seas.umich.edu), and my Bachelor of Science in Geographic Information Systems from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://gp.sysu.edu.cn/en).
