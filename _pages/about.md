Hello! I am an assistant professor at the [Department of Earth and Ocean Sciences](https://uncw.edu/academics/colleges/cse/departments/earth-ocean-sciences/), [University of North Carolina Wilmington](https://uncw.edu/). 

My research interest lies in the intersection of *remote sensing*, *machine learning*, *agriculture*, and *environmental sustainability*. I aim to better understand ecosystem dynamics under the changing climate through an integration of multi-scale remote sensing (e.g., satellite, drone, and near-surface platforms), field data collection, and GeoAI modeling. 

My ongoing work spans from near real-time crop characterization (e.g., crop type, crop progress, and health condition), remote identification of vegetation phenology, spatiotemporal fusion of multi-scale remote sensing images, to modeling climate change impacts on agricultural, forest, and coastal ecosystems. 

Before UNCW, I received my PhD in Geography from the [Department of Geography and Geographic Information Science](https://ggis.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu), where I worked with [Dr. Chunyuan Diao](https://ggis.illinois.edu/directory/profile/chunyuan) at the [Remote Sensing Space-Time Innovation Lab](https://diaorssilab.web.illinois.edu/). I obtained my Master of Science in Natural Resources and Environment from the [University of Michigan](https://seas.umich.edu), and my Bachelor of Science in Geographic Information Science from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://gp.sysu.edu.cn/en).
