Hello! I am a recent graduate Ph.D. from the [Department of Geography and Geographic Information Science](https://ggis.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu). 

My research interest lies in the intersection of remote sensing, machine learning, agriculture, and environmental sustainability. 

Prior to UIUC, I obtained a Master of Science in Natural Resources and Environment from the [University of Michigan](https://seas.umich.edu), and a Bachelor of Science in Geographic Information Systems from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/).
