Hello! I am a recent Ph.D. graduate from the [Department of Geography and Geographic Information Science](https://ggis.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu).

My research interest lies in the intersection of remote sensing, machine learning, agriculture, and environmental sustainability. My research leverages multi-scale remote sensing and geospatial data and advanced computational modeling methods to better understand ecosystem dynamics. Specifically, my recent works have been focusing on near real-time crop characterization (e.g., crop type mapping, crop phenology forecasting), spatiotemporal fusion of multi-scale remote sensing data, and understanding climate change impacts on agricultural systems.

Prior to UIUC, I obtained my Master of Science in Natural Resources and Environment from the [University of Michigan](https://seas.umich.edu), and my Bachelor of Science in Geographic Information Systems from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://gp.sysu.edu.cn/en).
