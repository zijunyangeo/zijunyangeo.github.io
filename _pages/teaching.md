### University of North Carolina Wilmington

> GGY 429/529 – Aerial Drone Applications in Geosciences, Instructor, [Fall 2014](https://seanet.uncw.edu/TEAL/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=202510&subj_code_in=GGY&crse_numb_in=429)

*Course description: Introduction to the various applications of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in the geosciences organized into four modules: introduction to remote sensing and photogrammetry, basics of UAS regulatory frameworks, field data collection using small UASs and an introduction to UAS-collected data processing using state-of-the-art software and processing tools.*

### University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

> GEOG 477 – Introduction to Remote Sensing, Guest Lecturer, [Fall 2019](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2019/fall/GEOG/477) and [Spring 2021](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2021/spring/GEOG/477)

*Course description: This course focues on fundamentals of energy-matter interaction mechanisms, and the manifestation of reflected and emitted radiation on photographs and images; introduces characteristics of aerial films and filters, electro-optical scanners, and digital processing; and emphasizes applications in environmental problems.*

- Designed a guest lecture on introduction to Google Earth Engine and basic programming
- Instructed students to access large geospatial datasets and conduct fundamental spatial analysis

> GEOG 379 – Intro to GIS Systems, Graduate Teaching Assistant, [Spring 2019](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2019/spring/GEOG/379)

*Course description: This course investigates the fundamentals of geographic information science as well as the basic skills in the execution of that theoretical knowledge with industry standard software packages. Student will learn the basics of projections and coordinate systems, how geographic information is stored and manipulated, and the theory and practice behind the production of thematic maps. This course includes lecture and hands-on laboratory components.*

- Led weekly lab sessions on geospatial analysis using ArcMap and ArcGIS Online
- Updated course materials and prepared new slides according to the software updates
- Designed grading rubrics for lab assignments, graded weekly lab assignments and exams

> GEOG 105 – Digital Earth, Graduate Teaching Assistant, [Fall 2018](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2018/fall/GEOG/105)

*Course description: Geospatial technologies such as global positioning systems (GPS) and geographic information systems (GIS) are becoming increasingly important tools in research and policy arenas and in everyday life. This course provides an introduction to these emerging technologies and to the principles of mapping science that underpin them. At the same time, the course explores how these innovative technologies are changing the spaces and places around us, including how we interact with the environment and each other. Lab exercises provide hands-on experience in collecting and mapping geospatial information, interpreting digital imagery and the Earth's environments, and critically thinking about the social implications of the digital Earth.*

- Led weekly lab and/or discussion sessions on geospatial technologies and their impacts on human societies
- Updated slides and materials for the lab and discussion activities

### University of Michigan

> [EAS 541 – Remote Sensing of Environment](https://seas.umich.edu/academics/courses/remote-sensing-environment), Graduate Student Instructor, Winter 2018

*Course description: Remote sensing, including aerial and satellite imagery is one of the most useful and important spatial information sources in both GIS and environmental sciences defined broadly. This course covers remote sensing data and methods in research and resource management in fields ranging from conservation ecology, GIS/informatics, environmental health and justice, climate change, geology, urban studies, biodiversity, land management, sustainability science, and many others. Lecture periods provide a comprehensive introduction to remote sensing principles and sensors/data. Weekly lab sessions provide for a hands-on experience of: main types of interpretation and analyses, use of widely-used ERDAS IMAGINE, ArcGIS Pro, and Google Earth Engine software, and different types of remote sensing imagery.*

- Instructed weekly lab sessions on remote sensing image processing with ERDAS
- Held office hours and study sessions to help students prepare for exams
- Revised grading rubrics for lab assignments and graded weekly lab assignments
