I will present my work "A novel deep learning framework for within-season field-level crop phenology characterization" in the session "[GeoAI and Deep Learning Symposium: GeoAI for Sustainable and Computational Agriculture I
](https://aag.secure-platform.com/aag2024/solicitations/57/sessiongallery/7219)".

Together with Chunyuan Diao, Yilun Zhao, and Zhijie Zhou from the University of Illinois, we are organizing paper sessions "AAG 2024 Symposium on Geospatial Data Science for Sustainability: Advances in multitemporal remote sensing for terrestrial ecosystems". See [session 1](https://aag.secure-platform.com/aag2024/solicitations/57/sessiongallery/7441) and [session 2](https://aag.secure-platform.com/aag2024/solicitations/57/sessiongallery/7666) for details!

The AAG Remote Sensing Specialty Group (RSSG) organizes both student paper competition ([session 1](https://aag.secure-platform.com/aag2024/solicitations/57/sessiongallery/7372) and [session 2](https://aag.secure-platform.com/aag2024/solicitations/57/sessiongallery/7373)) and [student poster competition](https://aag.secure-platform.com/aag2024/solicitations/57/sessiongallery/7811) this year, and I will be chairing the paper competition sessions.
